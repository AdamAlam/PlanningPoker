#Possible Features

- Ability for any connected user to add a link to TFS the user story being discussed. So that participants can read the story for themselves.

  - After each story, to point the next story, maybe a new story button which prompts the user for a TFS link.
  - When new story button is clicked, data for the previous story is saved.
  - Users can download session data for each discussed story when the session is over with a download csv button.

- Edit display name

- Ability to select name from a dropdown since the app will be team specific.

  - If this feature is added, the `Edit name` functionality will not be needed.

- Show pie chart with average, median and mode, low, and high.
  - Maybe add ability to hover over pie chart and show which users selected which value.
  - Pie chart should [slide fade](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/transitions/usage) when values are revealed.
  - [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/other-charts/pie.html) should work well for this function.
- Show user selection history for specific user story.
